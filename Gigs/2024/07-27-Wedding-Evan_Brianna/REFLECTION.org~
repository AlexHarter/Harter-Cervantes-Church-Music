- make sure the priest is onboard with what we are doing
- confirm what spaces and resources we have access to way beforehand
- make sure we have babysitting
- make sure our sheet music is rhythmically unambiguous
  - it seems I could have just as easily used proportional rhythm for the chants
- make sure we rehearse chants together - Alma can't sightread like I can
  - I wonder if organum would sound good
