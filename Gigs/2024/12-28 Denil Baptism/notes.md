- I'd love to record this Mass for sharing with others.
- The Denils might really appreciate a program, especially if Crystal has relatives in India.
- We will need to ask for help watching the kids.
- Requested hymns:
  - Processional: Adeste Fideles
  - Gloria in Excelsis Deo (standard TLM Mass setting)
  - Offertory: Gaudete
  - Communion: What Child is This
  - Recessional: Sing of Mary, Pure and Lowly
- Should Alma play piano at all, or keep it a cappella?
- Cantarium does not have all the propers as assigned in the Novus Ordo.  Should I arrange them myself or use the Holy Family Propers as in the TLM?
