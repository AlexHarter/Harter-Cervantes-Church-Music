## PSALMODY  
%%Psalms from the Abbey Psalter%%
  
![[Dominus custodit te.png]]
%%Psalm 120:7%%
**Psalm 121**  
I lift up my eyes to the mountains; \*  
from where shall come my help?  
My help shall come from the Lord \*  
who made heaven and earth.  
  
He will keep your foot from stumbling. \*  
Your guard will never slumber.
No, he sleeps not nor slumbers, \*  
Israel’s guard.  
  
The Lord your guard, the Lord your shade \*  
at your right side. 
By day the sun shall not smite you, \*  
nor the moon in the night.  
  
The Lord will guard you from evil; \*  
he will guard your soul.  
The Lord will guard your going and coming, \*  
both now and forever.  
  
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, \*  
and to the Holy Spirit:  
as it was in the beginning, is now, \*  
and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.

%%Psalm 129:3%%
**Psalm 130**
Out of the depths I cry to you, O Lord; \*  
Lord, hear my voice!  
O let your ears be attentive \*  
to the sound of my pleadings.  
  
If you, O Lord, should mark iniquities, \*  
Lord, who could stand?  
But with you is found forgiveness, \*  
that you may be revered.
  
I long for you, O Lord, \*  
my soul longs for his word.  
My soul awaits the Lord \*  
more than watchman for daybreak.  

More than watchmen for daybreak, \*  
let Israel for the Lord.  
For with the Lord there is mercy, \*  
in him is plentiful redemption.  
It is he who will redeem Israel \*  
from all its iniquities.  
  
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, \*  
and to the Holy Spirit:  
as it was in the beginning, is now, \*  
and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.  
  
![[Sicut Pater.png]]
%%John 5:21%%
**Canticle: Philippians 2:6-11**
Although he was in the form of God, †  
Christ Jesus did not regard equality with God \*  
something to be grasped.  
  
Rather he emptied himself, †  
taking on the form of a slave \*  
being born in human likeness.  
  
And found to be of human form, \*  
he humbled himself,  
becoming obedient unto death, \*  
death upon a cross.  
  
And for this, God highly exalted him,  
and bestowed on him the name \*  
that is above every other name,  
  
So that at the name of Jesus  
every knee shall bend \*
in the heavens, on the earth, and under the earth,  

And every tongue confess †  
that Jesus Christ is Lord
to the glory of God the Father. \*
  
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, \*  
and to the Holy Spirit:  
as it was in the beginning, is now, \*  
and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.  

## READING  
*1 Corinthians 15:55-57*
  %%TODO revise translation%%
O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting? The sting of death is sin, and sin gets its power from the law. But thanks be to God who has given us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.  
  
## RESPONSORY  
*Psalm 71:1; 31:8*
In you, O Lord, I take refuge; let me never be put to shame.  
— In you Lord is our hope. We shall never hope in vain.  
  
Let me be glad and rejoice in your mercy.  
— We shall never hope in vain.  
  
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.  
— In you Lord is our hope. We shall never hope in vain.  

## GOSPEL CANTICLE  
*John 6:37*
![[Omne quod dat mihi.png]]

**Canticle of Mary**  
*Luke 1:46-55*  

My soul ✠ proclaims the greatness of the Lord, †
and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, *
for he has looked upon his handmaid in her lowliness;
for behold, from this day forward, *
all generations will call me blessed.

For the Almighty has done great things for me, *
and holy is his name.
His mercy is from age to age *
for those who fear him.

He has made known the strength of his arm, *
and has scattered the proud in their conceit of heart.
He has cast down the mighty from their thrones *
and has exalted those who are lowly.
He has filled the hungry with good things, *
and has sent the rich away empty.

He has helped his servant Israel, *
mindful of his mercy,
even as he promised to our fathers, *
to Abraham and his descendants forever.
  
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, *  
and to the Holy Spirit:  
as it was in the beginning, is now, *  
and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.  
  
## INTERCESSIONS  
  
We acknowledge Christ the Lord through whom we hope that our lowly bodies will be made like his in glory, and we say:  
℟. Lord, you are our life and resurrection.
  
Christ, Son of the living God, who raised up Lazarus, your friend, from the dead,  
— raise up to life and glory the dead whom you have redeemed by your precious blood.  
℟. Lord, you are our life and resurrection.
  
Christ, consoler of those who mourn, you dried the tears of the family of Lazarus, of the widow’s son, and the daughter of Jairus,  
— comfort those who mourn for the dead.  
℟. Lord, you are our life and resurrection. 
  
Christ, Savior, destroy the reign of sin in our earthly bodies, so that just as through sin we deserved punishment,  
— so through you we may gain eternal life.  
℟. Lord, you are our life and resurrection.
  
Christ, Redeemer, look on those who have no hope because they do not know you,  
— may they receive faith in the resurrection and in the life of the world to come.  
℟. Lord, you are our life and resurrection.
  
You revealed yourself to the blind man who begged for the light of his eyes,  
— show your face to the dead who are still deprived of your light.  
℟. Lord, you are our life and resurrection.
  
When at last our earthly home is dissolved,  
— give us a home, not of earthly making, but built of eternity in heaven.  
℟. Lord, you are our life and resurrection.
  
## THE LORD’S PRAYER

Our Father, who art in heaven,  
hallowed be thy name;  
thy kingdom come;  
thy will be done on earth  
as it is in heaven.  
Give us this day our daily bread;

as we forgive those who trespass against us;  
and lead us not into temptation,  
but deliver us from evil.
